Let's begin with something simple: in Javascript **functions** are powerful tools. We can declare them once and give them multiple uses. 

However, when you learn a new language you will run into a little detail: **it has a different syntax** :disappointed_relieved: And this case is not the exception! Will it be really difficult to learn the new syntax? Let's see our first function in Javascript.

```javascript
function doble(number) {
   return 2 * number;
}
```

> Let's see if you are getting it: write a function `half` that takes a number and gives back its half. Have in mind that the division operator in Javascript is `/`.
