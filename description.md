Hello there! Perhaps you haven't realize it yet but you already know the basics of coding: you can declare functions and procedures, use variables, make decisions using the control structure "if", perform tasks multiple times.
:sunglasses:

However, in "real" programs we hardly ever use boards and color stones: coding goes further than that. How is it like to live outside the board?

In order to answer this question we will get inside the world of Javascript, a very popular language that **doesn't have a board**. But don't worry! you can still make use of everything you've learned so far and discover new ways to solve problems. :metal:
